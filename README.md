## Developed the sign in and sign up UI pages for the GChat application.
## We have connected the application to firebase and it is receiving the sent data.
## We will connect the signin and the sign up pages and then build the chat room service. 


## Features for the signup page:
- The username is more than 3 characters.
- The Email is verified by RegEx code that tells whether the input email is an email or not.
- And the password is masked so that other people dont see what you are typing using the function of ObsureText.
